## Uniform Demos RUN CLI

Uniform Demos CLI is a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool based on @clack/prompts
that allows you to export and run demos from your demos monorepo. The tool is designed to streamline the process of exporting demos and running them locally, without the need for a monorepo.

### Install and start using

1. To get started with Uniform Demos CLI, you'll need to install the dependencies by running the following command from exported project root:

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

2. Once you've installed the dependencies, you can start using the Uniform Demos CLI. To run the CLI, enter the following command in your terminal from the exported root:

   ```bash
   npm run cli
   ```

This will start the CLI and prompt you with a menu of options to choose from.

### Run Exported Demo

The Run Exported Demo feature allows you to run an exported demo locally. To use this feature, follow these steps:

- Run the CLI using the `npm run cli` command.
- Continue journey.
